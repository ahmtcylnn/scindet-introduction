# SCINDET - AI-Powered Skin Cancer Diagnosis Mobile Application

This project aims to assist in the diagnosis of skin cancer using a deep learning model with an **accuracy of 98%**. The model, trained on the **HAM10000 dataset**, is integrated into the mobile application to function both locally on devices and in the cloud via **Firebase ML Kit**. This hybrid design ensures secure and flexible usage for users.
